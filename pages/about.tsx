        <p className="text-xl mb-4">I&apos;m Marcin ðŸ‘‹ a 21-year-old full stack developer from Poland. I love to learn new things and build awesome software! I want to share my current knowledge and experience with the world and give something back to the community ðŸ’œ</p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-4">I&apos;ve spent most of my coding time making medium-sized projects that solve my own problems. Currently, I&apos;m working on bigger apps targeted for a wider audience. While doing it alone I&apos;ve learned to &quot;wear many different hats&quot; and discovered essentials about design, business, infrastructure and got deep into countless JS libraries ðŸ˜€</p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-4">On my blog you&apos;ll find resources from all of these areas. I&apos;d like to encourage you to work on your own awesome projects independently! ðŸ’¥</p>
        <p className="text-xl">Feel free to reach me out via Twitter <a href={TWITTER_URL} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" style={{ color: '#28b8ef' }}>@the_markolo</a></p>
